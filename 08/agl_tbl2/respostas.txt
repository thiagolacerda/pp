Questão 101
-----------

O mecanismo de fine-grained synchronization requer que os locks do nó
predecessor e do nó corrente sejam adquiridos nessa ordem. Portanto,
este mecanismo apresenta "locking coupling" o que pode ocasionar deadlocks.

Para garantir que não haverá deadlock, o mecanismo exige que todos os métodos
adquiram os locks (pred e curr) sempre na mesma ordem.

Questão 102
-----------

The fine-grained add() method is linearizable since it has a linearization
point. In case of a successful execution of add() (in other words, the element
to be added is not already in the list), the linearization point is when the
node with next higher key is locked.

Questão 103
-----------

Optimistic and lazy locking algorithms follow the same locking protocol as
fine-grained, thus they also have lock coupling.

These algorithms follows the same approach from fine-grained to avoid deadlock:
all methods acquire locks in the same order (predecessor and current), starting
at the head and following next references toward the tail.

Questão 105
-----------

public boolean contains(T item) {
	int key = item.hashCode();
	head.lock();
	Node pred = head;

	try {
		Node curr = pred.next;
		curr.lock();
		try {
			while (curr.key < key) {
				pred.unlock();
				pred = curr;
				curr = curr.next;
				curr.lock();
			}

			if (curr.key == key) {
				return false;
			}

		} finally {
			curr.unlock();
		}
	} finally {
		pred.unlock();
	}
}

Questão 106
-----------

Yes, as long as the locking order in remove() and contains() methods are
changed as well. The important thing to avoid deadlock in optimistic
synchronization approach is all methods acquire locks in the same order.

Questão 108
-----------

Since the list is traversed from head to tail, there is no way to access the
current node without have accessed the predecessor node. Additionally, the
locking order in add() is predecessor and then the current node.

As long as the predecessor's lock is held, no other thread is supposed to
access the current node. Therefore, acquiring the current's lock is not
really mandatory.
